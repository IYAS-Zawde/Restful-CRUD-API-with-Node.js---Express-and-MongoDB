# Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB
## Description
This is a basic project in which I intend to create an application for CRUD operations on MangoDB using NodeJS and Express Server, as well as RESTful APIs for all operations and HTTP requests. Those are the requests I've made with the Postman application.
## Basic features
- Get List Products
- Get Product By ID
- Add New Product
- Update Product
- Delete Product

### Note
Thanks for [@devtamin](https://github.com/devtamin) I've follow his Vedio on Youtube [Build Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB in 45 minutes for Beginners from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OfL9H6AmhQ)
